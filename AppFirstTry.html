Butterflies are some of the Longest tenured ambassadors of nature. The simple beauty and delicacy
of a butterfly has served to remind us to stop and smell the roses probably for as long as there have
been roses to smell!

verse. 

The butterfly walk is intended to be taken at your own pace and hopefully provides the flexibility to 
talk with any of the ambassadors along the way. 

Each button takes you to a different highlight of the path. We do not provide video because after all
the tour is around you not in your hand. Each button sends you to a small podcast - these are updated and will
change from time to time to keep things fresh. 

In the menu there is an identification page with pictures Taken here at Johns Pass. There is 
also a link to Butterflies and Moths of North America (BAMONA) detailing known species in Pinellas county florida

Also in the menu there is a quick link to your camera so that if there is a butterfly holding still you can interupt 
everything to quick grab a photo! 

We maintain our own data on butterflies here at johns pass and we support the larger effort of BAMONA. We welcome and
encourage citizen science types to grab a picture and add it to the database (there is a button on the menu for this!

The tour takes about an hour and encompasses about a one  mile full trip walk.
